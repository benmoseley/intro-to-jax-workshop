Heard of [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) but not sure what the fuss is about? 

Keen to learn about how JAX can be used for scientific computing and ML?

JAX is a (relatively) new python library for high-performance scientific computing and ML. 

The goal of this workshop is to:
1) Introduce you to JAX
2) Help you solve any JAX problems you have in your own work
3) Help build a community of JAX users at ETH

# Workshop Overview
This workshop consists of two parts:
1) Introduction to JAX (suitable for complete beginners)
2) Advanced Concepts in JAX (solving a more complex scientific problem with JAX)

Held at ETH Zurich, 25 June 2024

Organised by [Ben Moseley](https://github.com/benmoseley), [Paweł Czyż](https://github.com/pawel-czyz)
