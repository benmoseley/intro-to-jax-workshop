# Case study

This directory contains the material from the case study.
We use a time-homogeneous Markov chain to describe sequence data.

The problems and solutions are also available on Google Colab:

  - [Problems](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iseBXw9rlMEeRHns7dLHtakTe0wJq9OS)
  - [Solutions](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zL0dLPVFt5pmsqtBQJqNlQxHjsGgcjKm)

Note that some dependencies have to be installed before running the notebooks:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
